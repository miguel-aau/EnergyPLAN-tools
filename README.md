## EP- summary output conversion tool
This tool consists of a Python script to automate cleaning procedures to handle EnergyPLAN's output textfile. It converts the latter into a tidy, tabular, machine-readable format. The goal is to enhance interpretability and intercomparison of EnergyPLAN results.
